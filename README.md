# Project Name

## Description
This project is a 3D grid editor and simulator that allows users to create custom grids, place obstacles, and simulate a character moving within the grid environment. The editor provides tools to adjust grid size, wall height, block height, and character dimensions. Users can interact with the grid in 2D and visualize the simulation in 3D.

## Features
- Create custom 2D grids with adjustable parameters.
- Place obstacles such as objects, boxes, and walls within the grid.
- Simulate character movement in a 3D environment.
- Adjust character height and width for accurate representation.
- Real-time rendering of the grid and character movements.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Run the project on a local server to see the editor and simulator in action.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to access the 2D grid editor.
2. Adjust grid parameters, place obstacles, and save the grid configuration.
3. Switch to the 3D simulator by clicking on the appropriate button.
4. Use the settings panel to adjust character dimensions and simulate movement.
5. Interact with the character using WASD keys for movement and arrow keys for rotation.
6. Use this website `https://gltf-viewer.donmccurdy.com/` to render the exports of the 3D simulator, as the exports are in gltf format.

## Dependencies
- Three.js library for 3D rendering.
- LocalStorage for saving and retrieving grid data.
